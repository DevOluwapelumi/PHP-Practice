When creating a "Products" table in a PHP database, you'll want to define the fields (columns) that will store information about each product. The exact fields you need can vary depending on your specific application, but here are some common fields you might include in a "Products" table:

Product ID: A unique identifier for each product, often an auto-incremented integer.
Product Name: The name or title of the product.
Description: A brief description of the product.
Category: The category or type of the product (e.g., electronics, clothing, books).
Price: The price of the product.
Stock Quantity: The quantity of the product available in stock.
Manufacturer: The company or entity that manufactures the product.
Supplier: The company or entity that supplies the product.
Barcode: The barcode associated with the product for inventory management.
Release Date: The date when the product was released or added to your inventory.
Product Reviews: A field to store product reviews and ratings.
Your specific product database table may include additional fields depending on your business requirements, such as custom attributes or metadata specific to your products.
